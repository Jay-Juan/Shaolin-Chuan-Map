# Shaolin Chuan Map

This map contains the location of some branches of the "Shaolin Chuan" Kung Fu schools.

Within, you can find:  
 - A pin marking the location of each school
    - Custom made pin with the school's logo
 - By clicking or tapping the pin you can see:
    - The name and google maps link to the school's branches
    - The name of each branch's corresponding teacher
    - A WhatsApp link with a premade message

## Trying new things

Due to my love for Kung Fu and the Shaolin Chuan school, I took it upon myself to make something that would someday benefit the school and practice a little mapmaking along the way.

The new things I tried are:
- Implementing custom pins
- Putting a png on the browser tab
- Implementing a WhatsApp link to a specific number
- Implementing a premade message to send with the WhatsApp link

## Considerations

There is some information missing because I only included public knowledge, This is also why the WhatsApp links do not lead to a specific number.

You can check the WhatsApp link's functionality by filling the key called "numero" in any object in the Json and clicking the corresponding link.

Accepted format for trying the WhatsApp link:
 - If your number is "+(123) 456 789", You should write "+123456789"

I'm sorry I can't show it any other way, but it is for privacy reasons.
